READ ME:

A very quick read-me in order to be able to check some examples. 
In the folder res you can find the Grover's tests. 

To check the Translator you have to modify directly the Main.hs file in the src folder. 
In the section "examples" you can add some code in Quipper style, if you feel unsure just check the other examples. Then you have to modify the fall_out being sure to write the name of your example.

To compile the Main.hs file you have to open the terminal (be sure to be located in the src folder), type <quipper ./Main.hs> and then <./Main> to use it. 

We will soon update this very short version of the READ ME.
